    <h1> Is Owning A Pet Worth It?</h1>

    <p> Owning a pet is so common that more often than not when you speak ask someone, they'll tell you that they've owned a pet
        at some point in their lives. Some people love their pets so much they consider them as family members. On that note, people
        go to great lengths to take care of their pets but rarely think of the ways their pets take care of them. For example, it's 
        been said that people who own pets are usually in better health than those who don't. Is that really the case though? I've
        done some digging and below are my findings.

    <!-- The "p" tag is the paragraph tag and I used it to write the paragraph on my website. -->
   
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm">

        <div class="col-sm">
          <input type="text" class="my-4" placeholder="Con" id="con">
          <button id="add" class="btn btn-primary" >Submit</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- On lines 28-36, I created a form with a submission button by using HTML and Bootstrap. Line 28 is what allows  
   rows to be created. "col-sm" are used to create columns. lines 30 and 33 allow users to type their pro and con into the form.
   Line 34 creates the button. -->

    <!-- lines 44-50 create the top of the table. I used the HTML tags and a Bootstrap class to create it. "thead" is for putting
